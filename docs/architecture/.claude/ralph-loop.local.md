exhaustively cleanup the top level in docs/ untill its clear. there seems to be many files documentating diffenrt things, possibly with cnflicting information.. poorly named files. duplicates etc.. seem if the infomration is capture in the sub directoris on speciifc tops docs/*/*, challenge all data and confirm that thats the eisting implentation in the code.. some of these docs are old
