description: Evaluate quarterly questions with AI using collected evidence
---

Run AI evaluation on quarterly performance questions.

This will:
1. Gather evidence for each question from daily events
2. Include any manual notes you've added
3. Build a prompt with competency context
4. Generate a thoughtful response using Claude
5. Save the response to the question

The generated responses can be used as starting points for your quarterly connection answers.

**Tip:** Add manual notes first with `performance_question_note("accomplishments", "Led the billing system redesign")` to give the AI more context.
