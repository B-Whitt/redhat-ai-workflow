persona: personas/developer.md  # Defaults to developer persona, can adopt others

# Tool modules to load (from tool_modules/aa_*)

tools:
  - workflow      # 33 tools - Core (memory, persona, session, skill, infra, meta)

# Persona switching: Tools are fixed at startup, but persona changes via persona_load().
# When you say "load devops agent", Claude adopts the devops focus/expertise
# while keeping access to all the universal tools.

# - Development: start_work, create_mr, review_pr
# - Ephemeral deployment: test_mr_ephemeral
# - Production debugging: investigate_alert, debug_prod
